|Practice Programming Assignment: swirl Lesson 1: Basic Building Blocks |
|_______________________________________________________________________|

In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming language.

|==                                                                                      |   3%
| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.
                                                                                         |   5%
| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

> 5 + 7
[1] 12

| You are doing so well!

|======                                                                |   8%
| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

|=======                                                               |  11%
| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.

|=========                                                             |  13%
| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator,
| which is just a 'less than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It looks like this:
| <-


  |===========                                                           |  16%
| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

  |=============                                                         |  18%
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7.
| This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

> x <- 5 + 7

| That's a job well done!

  |===============                                                       |  21%
| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the
| assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately,
| but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.

  |=================                                                     |  24%
| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

> x
[1] 12

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==================                                                    |  26%
| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

> y <- x-3

| Excellent job!

  |====================                                                  |  29%
| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

> y
[1] 9

| All that practice is paying off!

  |======================                                                |  32%
| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that
| contains data is called a data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type
| of data structure in R. In fact, even a single number is considered a vector of
| length one.

...

  |========================                                              |  34%
| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for
| 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and
| 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called
| z.

> z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==========================                                            |  37%
| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's
| built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information
| on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a
| function name. Give it a try.

> ?c

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |============================                                          |  39%
| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values
| in the output.

> z
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

| You got it!

  |=============================                                         |  42%
| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z,
| 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so
| that we can just see the result immediately.

> c(z, 555, z)
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===============================                                       |  45%
| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see
| what happens: z * 2 + 100.

> z * 2 + 100
[1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

| You are amazing!

  |=================================                                     |  47%
| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to
| each element to get the result you see above.

...

  |===================================                                   |  50%
| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x
| squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the
| absolute value, use the abs() function.

...

  |=====================================                                 |  53%
| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

> sqrt(z)
[1] 1.048809 3.000000 1.772005

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Assign the result of sqrt(z - 1) to a variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z)

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Assign the result of sqrt(z - 1) to a variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1)

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |=======================================                               |  55%
| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it
| contains?

1: a vector of length 3
2: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)

Selection: 1

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=========================================                             |  58%
| Print the contents of my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| Keep up the great work!

  |==========================================                            |  61%
| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took
| the square root of each element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length
| as the original vector z.

...

  |============================================                          |  63%
| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by
| my_sqrt.

> my_div <- z/my_sqrt

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==============================================                        |  66%
| Which statement do you think is true?

1: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
2: my_div is undefined
3: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...

Selection: 3

| You are quite good my friend!

  |================================================                      |  68%
| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==================================================                    |  71%
| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified
| arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are
| of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same length
| as the longer vector.

...

  |====================================================                  |  74%
| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but
| technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

...

  |=====================================================                 |  76%
| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to
| make a vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what
| it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).

...

  |=======================================================               |  79%
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3,
| 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.

> b = c(1, 2, 3, 4)

| Not quite right, but keep trying. Or, type info() for more options.

| Enter c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10) in the console to see how R adds two vectors of
| different length. Don't assign the result to a variable.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
[1]  1 12  3 14

| That's a job well done!

  |=========================================================             |  82%
| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the
| longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a warning
| to let you know something fishy might be going on.

...

  |===========================================================           |  84%
| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
[1]   1  12 103   4
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=============================================================         |  87%
| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving
| tricks.

...

  |===============================================================       |  89%
| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a
| mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type
| the expression, or...

...

  |================================================================      |  92%
| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous
| commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command
| (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work
| for you, just type the corrected command.

> 
> z * 2 + 1000
[1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==================================================================    |  95%
| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you
| created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv.
| You could try both and see what works, or...

...my_div

  |====================================================================  |  97%
| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key
| (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of
| variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion
| and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a
| try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| If your programming environment doesn't support auto-completion, just type my_div
| and hit Enter to move on.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| All that practice is paying off!

|Practice Programming Assignment: Swirl Lesson 2: Workspace and Files |
|_____________________________________________________________________|


In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system of your machine.

  |==                                                                         |   3%
| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to
| things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.

...

  |====                                                                       |   5%
| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of
| commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across
| different kinds of computers.

...

  |======                                                                     |   8%
| Let's jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions work!

...

  |========                                                                   |  10%
| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory
| using getwd().

> getwd()
[1] "C:/Users/rimi2/Documents"

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |==========                                                                 |  13%
| List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

> ls()
 [1] "b"           "data"        "galton"      "my_div"      "my_sqrt"    
 [6] "newdata"     "result.mean" "test"        "x"           "y"          
[11] "z"          

| Keep up the great work!

  |============                                                               |  15%
| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a Mac.
| Both Linux and Mac operating systems are based on an operating system called Unix.
| It's always a good idea to learn more about Unix!

...

  |=============                                                              |  18%
| Assign 9 to x using x <- 9.

> x <- 9

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===============                                                            |  21%
| Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

> ls()
 [1] "b"           "data"        "galton"      "my_div"      "my_sqrt"    
 [6] "newdata"     "result.mean" "test"        "x"           "y"          
[11] "z"          

| Nice work!

  |=================                                                          |  23%
| List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir().

> dir()
 [1] "8 songs list.txt"                                                        
 [2] "abap.txt"                                                                
                                      

| You are doing so well!

  |===================                                                        |  26%
| As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for each new
| function. Check out the help page for list.files with the command ?list.files.

> ?list.files

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=====================                                                      |  28%
| One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also section. Read
| that section for list.files. Some of these functions may be used in later portions
| of this lesson.

...

  |=======================                                                    |  31%
| Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to see what
| arguments a function can take.


> args(list.files)
function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, 
    recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, 
    no.. = FALSE) 
NULL

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |===========================                                                |  36%
| Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".

> old.dir <- getwd()

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=============================                                              |  38%
| We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the place that we
| started. A lot of query functions like getwd() have the useful property that they
| return the answer to the question as a result of the function.

...

  |===============================                                            |  41%
| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called
| "testdir".

> dir.create("testdir")

| You are amazing!

  |=================================                                          |  44%
| We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it after we are
| done. This is the R analog to "Take only pictures, leave only footprints."

...

  |===================================                                        |  46%
| Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command.

> setwd("testdir")

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=====================================                                      |  49%
| In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace sensible, perhaps created for the specific project that you
| are working on. In fact, organizing your work in R packages using RStudio is an excellent option. Check out RStudio at
| http://www.rstudio.com/

...

  |======================================                                     |  51%
| Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R" using the file.create() function.

> ?file.create

> file.create("mytest.R")
[1] TRUE

| You're the best!

  |========================================                                   |  54%
| This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let's check this by listing
| all the files in the current directory.

| list.files() shows that the directory only contains mytest.R.

> list.files()
[1] "mytest.R"

| Nice work!

  |==========================================                                     |  56%
| Check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using the file.exists()
| function.

> file.exists("mytest.R")
[1] TRUE

| You got it right!

|============================================                                   |  59%
| These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But, if you are running a
| program that loops through a series of files and does some processing on each one, you
| will want to check to see that each exists before you try to process it.

...

  |==============================================                             |  62%
| Access information about the file "mytest.R" by using file.info().

| Change the name of the file "mytest.R" to "mytest2.R" by using file.rename().

> ?file.rename()
> file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |====================================================                       |  69%
| Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of tasks, but having the
| ability to manipulate files programatically is useful. You might now try to delete
| mytest.R using file.remove('mytest.R'), but that won't work since mytest.R no longer
| exists. You have already renamed it.

...

| Make a copy of "mytest2.R" called "mytest3.R" using file.copy().

[1] TRUE

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |========================================================                   |  74%
| You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem very interesting. But
| what if you were working with dozens, or millions, of individual files? In that case,
| being able to programatically act on many files would be absolutely necessary. Don't
| forget that you can, temporarily, leave the lesson by typing play() and then return by
| typing nxt().

  |==========================================================                 |  77%
| Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using file.path().

| You are doing so well!

  |============================================================               |  79%
| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the
| operating system your R code is running on. Pass 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to
| file.path to make a platform-independent pathname.

> file.path("folder1", "folder2")
[1] "folder1/folder2"

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |==============================================================             |  82%
| Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create . Notice the
| 'recursive' argument. In order to create nested directories, 'recursive' must be set to
| TRUE.

> ?dir.create

| You are really on a roll!

  |===============================================================            |  85%
| Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2" and a subdirectory
| for it called "testdir3", all in one command by using dir.create() and file.path().

> dir.create("testdir2", file.path("testdir3")) <WRONG>

| One more time. You can do it! Or, type info() for more options.

| dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE) will do the trick. If you
| forgot the recursive argument, the command may have appeared to work, but it didn't
| create the nested directory.

> dir.create( file.path("testdir2", "testdir3"), recursive = TRUE) <RIGHT>

| You got it right!

  |=================================================================          |  87%
| Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that we created the
| variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal working directory at the start of
| these questions.)

> setwd("old.dir")<WRONG>
Error in setwd("old.dir") : cannot change working directory
> setwd(old.dir) <RIGHT>

| Keep up the great work!

| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an analysis and
| then go back to them at the end. This trick is often used within functions; you save,
| say, the par() settings that you started with, mess around a bunch, and then set them
| back to the original values at the end. This isn't the same as what we have done here,
| but it seems similar enough to mention.

|Practice Programming Assignment: swirl Lesson 3: Sequences of Numbers |
|__________________________________________________________________ ___|

| In this lesson, you'll learn how to create sequences of numbers in R.

...

  |====                                                                              |   4%
| The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the `:` operator. Type
| 1:20 to see how it works.

> 1:20
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

| Excellent work!

  |=======                                                                           |   9%
| That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also use it to
| create a sequence of real numbers. For example, try pi:10.

> 
> pi:10
[1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |===========                                                                       |  13%
| The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142...) and increasing in
| increments of 1. The upper limit of 10 is never reached, since the next number in our
| sequence would be greater than 10.

...

  |==============                                                                    |  17%
| What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.

> 15:1
 [1] 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==================                                                                |  22%
| It counted backwards in increments of 1! It's unlikely we'd want this behavior, but
| nonetheless it's good to know how it could happen.

...

  |=====================                                                             |  26%
| Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you can access its
| documentation with a question mark followed by the function name: ?function_name_here.
| However, in the case of an operator like the colon used above, you must enclose the
| symbol in backticks like this: ?`:`. (NOTE: The backtick (`) key is generally located in
| the top left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab key. If you don't have a backtick key,
| you can use regular quotes.)

...

  |=========================                                                         |  30%
| Pull up the documentation for `:` now.

> ?:
Error: unexpected ':' in "?:"
> ?':'

| That's correct!

  |=============================                                                     |  35%
| Often, we'll desire more control over a sequence we're creating than what the `:`
| operator gives us. The seq() function serves this purpose.

...

  |================================                                                  |  39%
| The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:` operator. Try seq(1,
| 20) to see this.

> seq(1,20)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

| You are doing so well!

  |====================================                                              |  43%
| This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let's say that instead we want a vector
| of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5. seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that.
| Try it out.

> seq(1,10, by=0.5)
 [1]  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0  7.5  8.0  8.5  9.0
[18]  9.5 10.0

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for more
| options.

| You are still using the seq() function here, but this time with an extra argument that
| tells R you want to increment your sequence by 0.5. Try seq(0, 10, by=0.5).

> 
> seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
 [1]  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0  7.5  8.0
[18]  8.5  9.0  9.5 10.0

| That's a job well done!

  |=======================================                                           |  48%
| Or maybe we don't care what the increment is and we just want a sequence of 30 numbers
| between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does the trick. Give it a shot now and store the
| result in a new variable called my_seq.

> seq(5, 10, length = 30)
 [1]  5.000000  5.172414  5.344828  5.517241  5.689655  5.862069  6.034483  6.206897
 [9]  6.379310  6.551724  6.724138  6.896552  7.068966  7.241379  7.413793  7.586207
[17]  7.758621  7.931034  8.103448  8.275862  8.448276  8.620690  8.793103  8.965517
[25]  9.137931  9.310345  9.482759  9.655172  9.827586 10.000000

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for more
| options.

| You're using the same function here, but changing its arguments for different results. Be
| sure to store the result in a new variable called my_seq, like this: my_seq <- seq(5, 10,
| length=30).

> my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length = 30)

| Nice work!

  |===========================================                                       |  52%
| To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function. Try it now.

> length(my_seq)
[1] 30

| Excellent job!

  |==============================================                                    |  57%
| Let's pretend we don't know the length of my_seq, but we want to generate a sequence of
| integers from 1 to N, where N represents the length of the my_seq vector. In other words,
| we want a new vector (1, 2, 3, ...) that is the same length as my_seq.

...c(1:length(my_seq))

  |==================================================                                |  61%
| There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine the `:` operator
| and the length() function like this: 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.

> 1:length(my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
[30] 30

| That's correct!

  |=====================================================                             |  65%
| Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.

> seq(along.with = my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
[30] 30

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |=========================================================                         |  70%
| However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in function for
| this purpose called seq_along(). Type seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.

> seq_along(my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
[30] 30

| Nice work!

  |=============================================================                     |  74%
| There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly in R. Simple
| approaches that involve less typing are generally best. It's also important for your code
| to be readable, so that you and others can figure out what's going on without too much
| hassle.

...

  |================================================================                  |  78%
| If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it's likely that function is highly
| optimized for that purpose and is your best option. As you become a more advanced R
| programmer, you'll design your own functions to perform tasks when there are no better
| options. We'll explore writing your own functions in future lessons.

...

  |====================================================================              |  83%
| One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which stands for
| 'replicate'. Let's look at a few uses.

...

  |=======================================================================           |  87%
| If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use rep(0, times
| = 40). Try it out.

> rep(0, times = 40)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

| That's a job well done!

  |===========================================================================       |  91%
| If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1, 2), we can
| do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

> rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
 [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==============================================================================    |  96%
| Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and over again,
| we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones, then 10 twos. We can do this with
| the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).

> rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

| All that hard work is paying off!
