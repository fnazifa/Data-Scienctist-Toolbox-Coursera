1) R was developed by statisticians working at:

    Johns Hopkins University
    The University of Auckland
    Harvard University
    Microsoft
    
2) The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? Select all that apply.

    The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
    The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.
    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
    The freedom to sell the software for any price.
    The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.
    The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.
    The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.

3) In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT: (Select all that apply)

    data frame
    integer
    array
    list
    logical
    character
    table
    matrix
    numeric
    complex
    
4) If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

    integer
    logical
    complex
    numeric
    matrix
    character

5) What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?

    numeric
    integer
    character
    matrix
    list
    logical

6) If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?

    a 3 by 2 matrix
    a vector of length 3
    a 3 by 3 matrix
    a vector of length 2
    a matrix with two rows and three columns
    a 2 by 2 matrix
    
7) A key property of vectors in R is that

    a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions
    the length of a vector must be less than 32,768
    elements of a vector can only be character or numeric
    elements of a vector all must be of the same class
    elements of a vector can be of different classes
    
8) Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.

    a character vector containing the letter "a".
    a character vector of length 1.
    a list containing a character vector with the elements "a" and "b".
    a character vector with the elements "a" and "b".
    a list containing character vector with the letter "a".

9) Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?

    a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.
    an integer vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 4.
    a numeric vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 6.
    an integer vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.
    a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 4.
    a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.

10) Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

    x[x == 0] <- 6
    x[x >= 6] <- 0
    x[x <= 5] <- 0
    x[x > 0] <- 6
    x[x != 6] <- 0
    x[x > 6] <- 0
    x[x < 6] <- 0
    x[x == 6] <- 0
    x[x %in% 1:5] <- 0
    x[x == 0] < 6
    x[x < 6] == 0
