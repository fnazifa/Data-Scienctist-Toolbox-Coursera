Week 3 Quiz 3

Q.1) We take a random sample of individuals in a population and identify whether they smoke and if they have cancer. 
We observe that there is a strong relationship between whether a person in the sample smoked or not and whether 
they have lung cancer. We claim that the smoking is related to lung cancer in the larger population. We explain we think that the reason for this relationship is because cigarette smoke contains known carcinogens such as arsenic and benzene, which make cells in the lungs become cancerous.

    a) This is an example of a predictive data analysis.
    b) This is an example of an descriptive data analysis.
    c) This is an example of a causal data analysis.
    d) This is an example of an inferential data analysis. (RIGHT)

Q.2) What is the most important thing in Data Science?

    a) Using the right software.
    b) The data.
    c) The question you are trying to answer. (RIGHT)
    d) Statistical inference.

Q.3) If the goal of a study was to relate Martha Stewart Living Subscribers to Our Site's Users based on the number of people that lived in each region of the US, what would be the potential problem?

    a) There would be confounding because the number of people that live in an area is related to both Martha Stewart Living       Subscribers and Our Site's Users. (RIGHT)
    b) We would be performing inference on the relationship between Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.
    c) We wouldn't be able to estimate the variability in Martha Stewart Living Subscribers.
    d) We couldn't be sure whether subscribing to Martha Steward Living causes people to be Users of Our Site or the other          way around. 

Q.4) What is an experimental design tool that can be used to address variables that may be confounders at the design phase of an experiment?

    a) Taking a convenience sample.
    b) Fixing variables. (RIGHT)
    c) Using regression models.
    d) Only using non-confounding variables.
    e) Data cleaning.
    f) Using all the data you have access too.
    g) Using data from a database.

Q.5) What is the reason behind the explosion of interest in big data?

    a) There have been massive improvements in machine learning algorithms.
    b) Technologies like Hadoop and Map Reduce started the big data era.
    c) There have been massive improvements in statistical analysis techniques.
    d) The price and difficulty of collecting and storing data has dramatically dropped. (RIGHT)
    e) We recently discovered ways to use data to make predictions.
    f) We recently discovered ways to use data to answer scientific and business questions.
    g) We have better experimental design now than previously.
